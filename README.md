# tcp-schemes

This is the implementation for the 4th mini-project on CS220 Computer Networks in ShanghaiTech. 

The project includes the animation of flow control mechanism and retransmission schemes (2 in total, viz. the Go-back-N retransmission and selective retransmission) in common TCPs. One version of the animation is done using Javascript, and the other makes use of the browser widget in PyQt to embed the animation.
