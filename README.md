# tcp-schemes

This project includes the animation of flow control mechanism and retransmission schemes (2 in total, viz. the Go-back-N retransmission and selective retransmission) in common TCPs. One version of the animation is done using Javascript, and the other makes use of the browser widget in PyQt to embed the animation.
